- 👀 I’m interested in extentions, add-ons, etc. particularly to collect and organize data and other forms of information for international commerce, tourism, logistics, and service for academic or personal purposes 
- 🌱 I’m currently taking my real first step to github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on somethings in the future, but exploring at the moment
- 📫 You do not need to email me now; I got some learning to do
